# PyNet
Implementation of Neural Networks, Deep Learning algorithms and architechtures from scratch and in Pytorch.

> I implement neural networks and basic deep learning algorithms literally from scratch(Only using numpy package). Complex algorithms/architechtures are implemented in Pytorch.

## Purpose:
- To learn them deeply.
- Have coding experience.
- Implement code from research paper.
- Gain proficiency in Pytorch.

## Resources:
1. [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
2. [Pytorch Docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)
2. Research Papers(Just Google them).
