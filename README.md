# PyNet
Implementation of Neural Networks from scratch.

> I implement neural networks and deep learning algorithms literally from scratch. Only using numpy package.

## Purpose:
- To learn them deeply.
- Have coding experience.
- Implement code from research paper.

## Resources:
1. [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
2. Research Papers(Just Google them).
